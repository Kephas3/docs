### Avalanche Consensus Protocol

Avalanche is a third class of consensus protocol that combines the best of Nakamoto consensus
(scalable, robust, highly decentralized) with the best of Classical consensus (low latency, high throughput, lightweight, green, sustainable).
Avalanche is a probabilistic protocol; it uses probability to make the chance of error just as microscopic.

Avalanche uses Proof of Stake to force validators to stake 2000AVAX before being allowed to vote on transactions.

The Avalanche Consensus Protocol works like a voting protocol. When a validator is determining whether a transaction is valid or not,
it asks a small random number of validators if the transaction should be accepted or rejected.
If the majority of queried validators think the transaction should be rejected, 
the validator replies that it thinks the transaction should be rejected. 

However, if the queried validators think the transaction should be accepted, the validator node accept it. 
This process is repeated for n rounds until a sufficient confidence threshold is reached, 
if this case then the transaction is accepted, if not it is definitively rejected.

You can find more technical infos about the Avalance consensus protocol by reading the [whitepaper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.08936.pdf).

### Validators
Validators are nodes responsible for verifying transactions. They are given rewards by validating transactions. Nodes need to stake a minimum amount of 2000AVAX to be validators.

Validators secure the network by creating new blocks/vertices.

### Delegators
A delegator is a token holder, who wants to participate in staking, but chooses to trust an existing validating node through delegation.

### Subnets
A Subnet is a set of validators working together to form a sovereign network. Subnets have their own rules regarding its membership and token economics. Avalanche has three built in blockchains: P-Chain, C-Chain and X-C which are validated by all validators on the network known as the Primary Network.
